Reverse Shells in python 

Well you guys should know how to use this program but i have to write this for script kiddies.......

HOW TO USE:

1. Edit the Listener.py where " IP = '127.0.0.1' " replace the IP with your Ipv4 address of your computer.
2. Do the same for the RAT.py. 
3. Run the Listener.py to open the listener(always run this first)
4. Now when the Rat.py will run on the victem's computer, you will get the shell :)
